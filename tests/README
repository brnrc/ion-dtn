Directory layout
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This directory contains the test suite.  Each test lives in its own
subdirectory of this directory.  Each test is implemented by a script
named "$TESTNAME/dotest".


Running the tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The tests are run by running "make test" in the top-level directory,
or by running "runtests" in this directory.

A subset of the tests can also be run:

	./runtests xyz a*

A file defining a set of tests can be run with runtestset.  The arguments
to runtestset are files that contain globs of tests to run:

    ./runtestset quicktests


Writing new tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A test directory must contain an executable file named "dotest".  If a
directory does not contain this, then the test directory is ignored.

The dotest program should execute the test, possibly reporting runtime
information on stdout and stderr, and indicate by its return value the
status of the test:

    0: Success

    1: Failure

    2: Skip this test

The test program starts without the ION stack running.  The test program
is responsible for starting the ION stack in the way it wants to test.
The test program *must* stop the ION stack before returning.


The test environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The tests' dotest scripts are run in their test directory.

The following environment variables are set as indicated:

    IONDIR is the root of the local ION source directory

    PATH begins with IONDIR (this is where the local executables are
    found)
