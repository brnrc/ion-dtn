# Tests "limbo" system:
#
#	a.  When an outduct is blocked, all bundles currently queued
#	    for that outduct are removed from their queues and are
#	    reforwarded; if no other outbound route is available, those
#	    bundles are appended to the "limbo" queue.  In addition,
#	    any new bundles that would otherwise be queued to the
#	    blocked outduct are likewise appended to the "limbo" queue.
#
#	b.  When a blocked outduct is unblocked, all bundles in the
#	    "limbo" queue are automatically reforwarded in hopes that
#	    some or all of them may be transmitted via the newly
#	    unblocked duct.
#
#	c.  Ducts may be manually blocked and unblocked by bpadmin
#	    directives.
#
#	d.  Also, an EPIPE error on transmission over a TCP outduct
#	    will cause that outduct to be blocked automatically;
#	    a subsequent successful connection for that outduct (as
#	    by a keepalive thread) will automatically unblock it.
#
# This test first sends a file over a TCP outduct, then uses bpadmin
# to block the duct and tries to send a second file; the second file
# goes into limbo and is released from limbo when we then use bpadmin
# to unblock the duct.
#
# Then we test automatic TCP outduct blockage.  We again send a file,
# then shut down the receiving node altogether, let the keepalive
# thread detect the socket closure, blocking the outduct, and then
# send another file.  The second file goes into limbo and is released
# from limbo when the receiving node is restarted and reopens its TCP
# socket, enabling the keepalive thread to unblock the outduct.
#
# Finally, we trigger an automatic blockage again. But, this time with
# a backup contact active for the bundle to reForward through
# when the preferred contact is blocked.
